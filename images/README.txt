HOW TO ADD YOUR MOVIE IMAGES:

1. Add your movie poster images to this folder
2. Name them as: movie1.jpg, movie2.jpg, movie3.jpg, etc. (up to movie10.jpg)
3. Recommended image size: 200x300 pixels (portrait orientation)
4. Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp

If you want to use different image names, update the src in index.html:
- Find: <img src="images/movie1.jpg" alt="Movie 1">
- Change "movie1.jpg" to your image filename

The images will appear behind the large numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.)
